                <p>
                Lucas Fridman is an undergraduate chemical engineering major at Case Western Reserve University and has been studying energy production and consumption since high school. Since coming to Case, Lucas has worked as a researcher in the Solar Durability and Lifetime Extension (SDLE) Center studying the degradation of photovoltaic module backsheets. Within the center, Lucas was exposed to innovative methods utilized by his peers to perform energy audits of various buildings on campus. This combined his passion for energy, as well as his enrollment in an introductory thermodynamics course, inspired his interest in the optimization of energy consumption within buildings. Lucas lives in Cleveland, OH.

                    <p>HVAC Optimization Solutions is consulting firm with a focus centered around the client. We have your best interests at heart because what is good for your business is our business. Founded by two friends on the campus of Case Western Reserve University, HVAC OS knows what savings mean to a small business. Because of this, we have devoted ourselves to saving small businesses money. By integrating a system of sensors into HVAC systems and applying an innovative engineering approach to problem solving, we can identify inefficiencies and code infractions in HVAC systems. After gathering all the relevant information, we sit and brainstorm until we can provide simple and cost effective solutions to the problems we discovered. Using a series of calculations we can also determine the approximate savings that installation of our proposed solution will provide. </p>

                    <p>We at HVAC OS are able to fully consider our clientsâ€™ best interests because we are uninterested in profiting from the installations of our proposed solutions. As a consulting firm, we are only involved in installation if you, the client, wants us to be. We work like this:<p>
                    <p class="bullets">
                        <br> - First we come in for a consultation. We will discuss any system issues you may have noticed as well as possible reasons for these issues.
                        <br>- Following this meeting we will return with equipment which we will then use to analyze your system more thoroughly.
                        <br>- From there, we will analyze the data we collect, interpret it in the context of inefficiencies, and develop a list of potential solutions as well as the savings associated with those solutions.
                        <br>- Finally, you sign a consultation contract and we hand you a formal invoice containing all information pertaining to each solution. From there you have two options:
                        <br>  - Hire your own contractors to complete the installations.
                        <br>  - Have us hire contractors for you to complete the installations.
                    </p>
                    <p>Regardless of what you choose, when our business is done, we leave you to with solutions and these solutions are the means by which you can optimize your HVAC system.</p>
